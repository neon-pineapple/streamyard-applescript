# Control Streamyard Using AppleScript
Control Streamyard, a cloud-based livestream studio, using AppleScript commands on macOS computers.

This repository contains a collection of AppleScript files that can be used inside programs like QLab or with control surfaces like the Elgato Stream Deck.

You can control the following Streamyard elements with these scripts:

- Banners
- Camera (Your Own)
- Layouts
- Overlays

Some commands, like turning your camera on and off can be run as-is without any modification.

Other commands, like displaying a banner, require you to edit a variable at the top of the file. These files are best run by copying the contents of the script file into the program that will run it.


## Stream Deck
To use these scripts with the original Steram Deck software from Elgato, you'll need the following plugin:
